# Cecil Website Template

A template to speed up the creation of a new [Cecil](https://cecil.app/)-based
website.

This is designed to create the structures I most commonly use in a new project;
it includes default setup stuff for Bootstrap, an automatic build/deploy scripts.


## Usage

* Create a new project using this template
* Edit this `README.md`(!) and the Cecil `config.yml`
* Add any customisations to `assets/cecil-custom-bs.scss`
* Derive any layouts you require from `layouts/base.html.twig`
* Check the notes in `bin/deploy.sh`, and edit it to reflect your deployment
* Add your pages
* Enjoy!
